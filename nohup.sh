Run Program After Session Killing

When you run any program in the background and close you, it will be killed by your shell. 
How can you continue running the program after closing the shell?

This can be done using a nohup command — which stands for no hang-up:

nohup wget site.com/file.zip 

This command is one of the most forgotten Linux command line tricks because many of us use another command-like screen:

nohup ping -c 10 google.com

A file will be generated in the same directory with the name nohup.out, which contains the output of the running program.
