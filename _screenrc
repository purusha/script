# use the caption line for the computer name, load, hstatus (as set by zsh), & time
# the caption line gets repeated for each window being displayed (using :split),
# so we'll use color cues to differentiate the caption of the current, active
# window, and the others.
#    always                  - display the caption continuously.  Since
#                              hardstatus is 'alwayslastline', it will be on the
#                              next to last line.
#    "%?%F"                  - if (leading '%?') this region has focus ('%F') 
#                              (e.g. it's the only region being displayed, or,
#                              if in split-screen mode, it's the currently active
#                              region)
#      "%{= Kk}"               - set the colorscheme to blac[k] on grey (bright blac[K]),
#                                with no other effects (standout, underline, etc.)
#    "%:"                    - otherwise ('%:' between a pair of '%?'s)
#      "%{=u kR}"              - set the colorscheme to [R]ed on blac[k], and
#                                underline it, but no other effects (bold, standout, etc.) 
#    "%?"                    - end if (trailing '%?')
#    "  %h "                 - print two spaces, tthne the [h]ardstatus of the
#                              current tab window (as set by zsh - see zshrc) and
#                              then another space.
#    "%-024="                - either pad (with spaces) or truncate the previous
#                              text so that the rest of the caption string starts
#                              24 characters ('024') from the right ('-') edge of
#                              the caption line.
#                              NOTE: omitting the '0' before the '24' would pad
#                              or truncate the text so it would be 24% from the
#                              right.
#    "%{+b}                  - add ('+') [b]old to the current text effects, but
#                              don't change the current colors.
#    " %C:%s%a %D %d %M %Y"  - print the [C]urrent time, a colon, the [s]econds,
#                              whether it's [a]m or pm, the [D]ay name, the [d]ay
#                              of the month, the [M]onth, and the [Y]ear.
#                              (this takes up 24 characters, so the previous
#                              pad/truncate command makes sure the clock doesn't
#                              get pushed off of the caption line)
#    "%{= dd}"               - revert to the [d]efault background and [d]efault
#                              foreground colors, respectively, with no ('= ')
#                              other effects.
#  other things that might be useful later are
#    " %H"                   - print a space, then the [H]ostname.
#    "(%{.K}%l%{-}):"        - print a '(', then change the text color to grey
#                              (aka bright blac[K]), and print the current system
#                              [l]oad.  Then revert to the previous colorscheme
#                              ('%{-}') and print a close ')' and a colon.
#                              NOTE: the load is only updated when some other
#                              portion of the caption string needs to be changed
#                              (like the seconds in the clock, or if there were a
#                              backtick command)
#    "%0`"                   - put the output of a backtick command in the line
#    "%-024<"                - don't pad, just truncate if the string is past 24
#                              characters from the right edge
#    "%-="                   - pad (with spaces) the previous text text so that
#                              the rest of the caption string is justified
#                              against the right edge of the screen.
#                              NOTE: doesn't appear to truncate previous text.
